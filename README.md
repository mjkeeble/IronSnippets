# Javascript code snippets

Over the past two weeks I've realised that syntax errors are oftrn the cause of bugs that we have to spend far too long hunting. I think snippets could be a good way to tackle that because they can provide the basic syntax for code elements we use often and help avoid errors.

I have started to compile a snippet file (for now just JavaScript) to build up a library of snippets for regularly used program elements. Feel free to use this and to let me know if you find any bugs or want to have items added.

For a good video on snippets and how to get them installed see here: https://youtu.be/K3gLlZm-m_8

Have fun,
